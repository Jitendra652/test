Build a full-stack SaaS frontend application that integrates with the following existing backend API (OpenAPI 3.0 spec included below).

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (fully responsive + dark mode)
- State Management: React Query for API calls and caching
- Auth: JWT-based authentication using backend endpoints
- Charts: Chart.js or Recharts for analytics
- Notifications: WebSockets for real-time events
- PWA support (service worker + manifest)
- SEO optimized with meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data
- Deployment-ready in Replit (npm scripts, vite config)

Features:

1. Authentication
- Register via `/v1/auth/register`
- Login via `/v1/auth/login` (save JWT to cookies/localStorage with “Remember Me”)
- Forgot Password: frontend flow (integrate when backend available)
- Email verification + 2FA toggle (frontend only for now)

2. Dashboard
- Fetch user overview from `/v1/auth/login` response + profile
- Show usage stats (API calls, storage) using `/v1/metrics`
- File operations: `/v1/upload`, `/v1/files/generate-token`, `/v1/files/download`, `/v1/transform`
- Payment history via `/v1/user/execute-payment`, `/v1/user/cancel-payment`
- Subscription details via `/v1/user/create-payment`

3. Payments & Plans
- Integrate PayPal with:
  - `/v1/user/create-payment` → approval URL
  - `/v1/user/execute-payment` → finalize plan upgrade
  - `/v1/user/cancel-payment` → handle cancellation
- Plans:
  - Free: 1GB, 1,000 API calls
  - Basic: 5GB, 5,000 calls, analytics, $10/month
  - Premium: 10GB, 10,000 calls, priority support, $20/month
- Success & failure payment pages

4. File Management
- Upload, download, generate tokens, and transform images

5. Error Handling
- Show API errors (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`)
- Handle expired JWT by redirecting to login
- Fallback error page

6. Advanced Features
- Real-time notifications (payments, plan expiration) via WebSockets
- Analytics dashboard with API usage charts, storage progress bars, payment trends
- Admin Panel:
  - User management via `/v1/admin/seed`
  - View payment records
  - System analytics via `/v1/metrics`
